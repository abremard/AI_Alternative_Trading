&quot;Microvast‚Äôs stars appear to be shining brighter than ever. As an illustration, back in February 2021, Microvast had entered into a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) with Oshkosh for battery production. The agreement forms the foundation for further collaboration. Moreover, as a part of this arrangement, Oshkosh also agreed to inject $25 million in the PIPE investment associated with Microvast.

Tuscan Holdings - that serve as a proxy for Microvast in the pre-merger phase - are currently up around 25 percent.&quot;
