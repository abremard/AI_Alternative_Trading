# Deep learning and NLP methods for market prediction
## Scientific context:
Deep learning is a strategic tool that many industries can benefit from, including the investment industry. Algorithmic trading relies on statistical knowledge, computational skills and domain expertise. With the explosion of big data, the potential and the complexity of deep learning models have significantly increased. Algorithmic trading training data is no longer limited to time series and now includes a variety of sources : news, social media, forums, satellite images, weather dataâ€¦ basically anything that can influence a buyers or sellers understanding and behavior on the market. Deep Learning for Algorithmic Trading is getting more and more attention from the research community but also from individual traders who can no longer rely on traditional technical or fundamental analysis.
## Modules:
This research project uses various python modules for each step in the process:\r\n
- Scrape module for data extraction
- Elk module for Elastic Search integration
- Utils module
